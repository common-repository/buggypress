== Description ==

A simple bug-tracking/issue-tracking/case-management system.

Create new issues just as you would a post. Each issue can be assigned a status, priority, and issue type. Issues can be assigned to specific users on the site.

Projects are stored in a separate taxonomy. Issues can be assigned to projects just as you assign posts to categories.

Issues can be update or reassigned through the comment form.
